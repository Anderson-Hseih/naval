## Find and Build Specific Knowledge

查找并构建特定知识

Sales skills are a form of specific knowledge.

销售技能是特定知识的一种形式。

There’s such a thing as “a natural” in sales. You run into them all the time in startups and venture capital. When you meet someone who is a natural at sales, you just know they’re amazing. They’re really good at what they do. That is a form of specific knowledge.

在销售中有一种叫做“自然”的东西。在初创企业和风险投资中，你总是会遇到他们。当你遇到一个在销售方面很有天赋的人时，你就会知道他们很令人惊叹。他们真的很擅长他们的工作。这是特定知识的一种形式。

Obviously they learned somewhere, but they didn’t learn it in a classroom setting. They learned probably in their childhood in the school yard, or they learned negotiating with their parents. Maybe some is a genetic component in the DNA.

显然，他们是在某个地方学习的，但他们不是在课堂上学习的。他们可能是在童年时在学校院子里学习的，或者他们学会了与父母谈判。也许有些是DNA中的遗传成分。

But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you can go to a sales training seminar, you can do door -to -door sales. It is brutal but will train you very quickly. You can definitely improve your sales skills.

但是你可以提高销售技巧。你可以读罗伯特·恰尔迪尼的书，你可以去参加销售培训研讨会，你可以上门推销。这很残酷，但会很快训练你。你一定可以提高你的销售技能。

Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.
具体的知识不能教，但可以学。

When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn’t even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.

当我谈到具体知识时，我的意思是几乎毫不费力地弄清楚你小时候或十几岁时在做什么。一些你甚至不认为是技能的东西，但是你周围的人注意到了。你的母亲或者你从小到大最好的朋友都会知道。

Examples of what your specific knowledge could be:

举例说明您的特定知识可能是什么：
* Sales skills
* 销售技巧
* Musical talents, with the ability to pick up any instrument
* 音乐天赋，能拿起任何乐器
* An obsessive personality: you dive into things and remember them quickly
* 强迫型性格：你一头扎进东西里，很快就能记住它们
* Love for science fiction: you were into reading sci -fi , which means you absorb a lot of knowledge very quickly
* 喜欢科幻：你喜欢看科幻小说，这意味着你很快就吸收了很多知识。
* Playing a lot of games, you understand game theory pretty well
* 玩了很多游戏，你很懂博弈论
* Gossiping, digging into your friend network. That might make you into a very interesting journalist.
* 八卦，挖掘你的朋友网络。这可能会让你成为一名非常有趣的记者。

The specific knowledge is sort of this weird combination of unique traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it. It’s almost baked into your personality and your identity. Then you can hone it.

具体的知识是来自你的DNA的独特特征，你独特的教养，以及你对此的反应的某种奇怪的组合。它几乎已经融入了你的个性和身份。然后你就可以磨练它了。

No one can compete with you on being you.
在做你这一点上，没有人能与你竞争。

Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
人生的大部分时间都是在寻找最需要你的人和事。

For example, I love to read, and I love technology. I learn very quickly, and I get bored fast. If I had gone into a profession where I was required to tunnel down for twenty years into the same topic, it wouldn’t have worked. I’m in venture investing, which requires me to come up to speed very, very quickly on new technologies (and I’m rewarded for getting bored because new technologies come along). It matches up pretty well with my specific knowledge and skill sets. [10]
例如，我喜欢阅读，我喜欢科技。我学得很快，我很快就会感到无聊。如果我从事的职业要求我在同一主题上钻研二十年，那就行不通了。我从事的是风险投资，这要求我非常、非常快地掌握新技术(我会因为新技术的出现而感到无聊而得到奖励)。它与我的特定知识和技能非常匹配。“[10]

I wanted to be a scientist. That is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists as being at the top of the production chain for humanity. The group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings. Not to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without science, we’d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.

我想成为一名科学家。这就是我的许多道德等级制度的来源。我认为科学家处于人类生产链的顶端。我认为，这群真正取得突破和贡献的科学家对人类社会的贡献可能比其他任何一个阶层的人都多。我不想夺走艺术、政治、工程或商业上的任何东西，但如果没有科学，我们仍然会在泥土中争先恐后地用棍子搏斗，试图纵火。
Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity.

社会、商业和金钱都在技术的下游，而技术本身又在科学的下游。应用的科学是人类的引擎。
Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years.

推论：应用科学家是世界上最有权势的人。这一点在未来几年将更加明显。

My whole value system was built around scientists, and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things and talking to people.



我的整个价值体系都是围绕科学家建立的，我想成为一名伟大的科学家。但当我真正回顾我唯一擅长的是什么，以及我最终把时间花在了什么上时，我更多地是在赚钱，修补技术，向人们推销东西。解释事情，和人们交谈。

I have some sales skills, which is a form of specific knowledge. I have some analytical skills on how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down—that is a specific skill that I have. I also love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.
我有一些销售技能，这是具体知识的一种形式。我对如何赚钱有一些分析技巧。我有能力吸收数据，沉迷于它，并将其分解--这是我拥有的一项特殊技能。我也喜欢修补技术。所有这些东西对我来说都像是玩乐，但对其他人来说却像是工作。

There are other people to whom these things would be hard, and they say, “Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?” Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, maybe it’s not your thing—focus on the thing that you are really into.
还有一些人很难做到这一点，他们会说，“那么，我怎样才能变得精练，善于推销想法呢？”嗯，如果你还不擅长它，或者你不是真的喜欢它，也许这不是你的事情--专注于你真正喜欢的事情。

The first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen, and she said it when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist, and she said, “No, you’re going to go into business.” I was like, “What, my mom’s telling me I’m going to be in business? I’m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn’t know she’s talking about.” But Mom knew exactly what she was talking about. [78]
第一个真正指出我的具体知识的人是我的母亲。她在厨房里说话，只是顺便说一句，她在我十五六岁的时候说了这句话。我告诉我的一个朋友，我想成为一名天体物理学家，她说，“不，你要做生意。”我就想，“什么，我妈妈告诉我我要做生意？我要成为一名天体物理学家。妈妈不知道她在说什么。“但是妈妈非常清楚她在说什么。

Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it’s not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.
通过追求你与生俱来的才华、你真正的好奇心和你的热情，可以发现更多具体的知识。这并不是为了什么最热门的工作而去上学，也不是通过进入投资者所说的最热门的领域。

Very often, specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It’s also stuff that’s only now being figured out or is really hard to figure out. If you’re not 100 percent into it, somebody else who is 100 percent into it will outperform you. And they won’t just outperform you by a little bit—they’ll outperform you by a lot because now we’re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies. [78]
很多时候，具体的知识处于知识的边缘。它也是现在才被弄清楚或者真的很难弄清楚的东西。如果你不是百分之百投入其中，那么其他百分百投入其中的人会比你表现得更好。而且他们的表现不会只比你稍微好一点-他们会比你表现得好很多，因为现在我们正在经营思想领域，复利真的适用，杠杆真的适用。“[78]
The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.
互联网极大地拓宽了可能的职业空间。大多数人还没有弄清楚这一点。

You can go on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet. [78]
你可以上网，你可以找到你的观众。你可以建立一个企业，创造一个产品，创造财富，仅仅通过互联网独特地表达你自己就能让人们感到快乐。“[78]
The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best person at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something—being themselves.
只要你是向外扩展的最佳人选，互联网就能让你对任何利基市场感兴趣。好消息是，因为每个人都是不同的，每个人都是最擅长的--做自己。

Another tweet I had that is worth weaving in, but didn’t go into the “How to Get Rich” tweetstorm, was very simple: “Escape competition through authenticity.” Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy. [78]
我的另一条推文很简单，很值得编织进去，但没有进入“如何致富”的推文风暴：“通过真实来逃避竞争。”基本上，当你与人竞争时，是因为你在模仿他们。那是因为你也在试着做同样的事情。但是每个人都是不同的。不要抄袭。“[78]
If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that. Who’s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It’s impossible. Is somebody else going to come along and write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No. They’re being authentic. [78]
如果你从根本上构建和营销的东西是你自己的延伸，没有人能在这方面与你竞争。谁将与乔·罗根或斯科特·亚当斯竞争？不可能的。会有其他人来写一部更好的呆伯特作品吗？不是的。会有人与比尔·沃特森竞争，创造一个更好的加尔文和霍布斯吗？不是的。他们是真实的。)[78]
The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.
最好的工作既不是命令，也不是学位。它们是自由市场中不断学习的人的创造性表现。

The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.
致富最重要的技能是成为一个永久的学习者。你必须知道如何学习任何你想学的东西。旧的赚钱模式是上学四年，拿到学位，做三十年的专业人员。但现在情况变化很快。现在，你必须在九个月内跟上一个新职业的步伐，四年后它就过时了。但在这三年内，你可以变得非常富有。

It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand -new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important. [74]
今天，能够在9到12个月内成为一个全新领域的专家，比起很久以前研究“正确”的东西要重要得多。你真的很在乎学过基础，所以你什么书都不怕。如果你去图书馆，发现一本你看不懂的书，你必须向下挖掘，然后说：“我学习这本书需要什么基础？”基础是超级重要的。

Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.
在生活中，基本的算术和算术比微积分重要得多。同样，能够简单地用普通的英语单词表达自己，要比会写诗、词汇量大或会说七种不同的外语重要得多。

Knowing how to be persuasive when speaking is far more important than being an expert digital marketer or click optimizer. Foundations are key. It’s much better to be at 9/10 or 10/10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into things.
知道如何在演讲时具有说服力比成为一名专业的数字营销者或点击优化器要重要得多。基础是关键。在基础上保持9/10或10/10比试图深入到事情中要好得多。

You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It’s usually things you’re obsessed about. [74]
你确实需要深入到某件事中去，否则你会陷入一英里宽一英寸深的境地，你将得不到你想从生活中得到的东西。你只能在一两件事上做到精通。这通常是你痴迷的事情。


 Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People
与长期的人一起玩长期游戏
You said, “All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.” How does one know if they’re earning compound interest?
你说过，“生活中所有的回报，无论是财富、关系还是知识，都来自复利。”怎么知道他们是否赚取了复利呢？
Compound interest is a very powerful concept. Compound interest applies to more than just compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.
复利是一个非常强大的概念。复利不仅仅适用于复利资本。复合资本只是个开始。

Compounding in business relationships is very important. Look at some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a public company or managing billions of dollars. It’s because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they’ve built and the work they’ve done has compounded. They’ve stuck with the business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to be high -integrity people.
商业关系中的复利是非常重要的。看看社会上的一些最高职位，比如为什么有人是上市公司的首席执行官，或者管理着数十亿美元的资产。这是因为人们信任他们。他们之所以值得信任，是因为他们建立的关系和他们所做的工作相得益彰。他们坚持自己的业务，并(以一种明显和负责任的方式)展示了自己是高度正直的人。

Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.
复利也会影响你的声誉。如果你拥有卓越的声誉，并在几十年的时间里不断建立这种声誉，人们就会注意到。你的声誉最终会比那些才华横溢但没有保持声誉的复利的人高出几千倍或几万倍。

This is also true when you’re working with individual people. If you’ve worked with somebody for five or ten years and you still enjoy working with them, obviously you trust them, and the little foibles are gone. All the normal negotiations in business relationships can work very simply because you trust each other—you know it will work out.
当你和个别人一起工作时，这也是正确的。如果你和某人共事了五年或十年，而你仍然喜欢和他们一起工作，显然你信任他们，小缺点也就消失了。商业关系中所有正常的谈判都能奏效，原因很简单，因为你们彼此信任--你知道它会成功的。

For example, there’s another Angel in Silicon Valley named Elad Gil who I like to do deals with.
例如，硅谷有一个叫Elad Gil的天使，我喜欢和他做交易。

I love working with Elad because I know when the deal is being done, he will bend over backward to give me extra. He will always round off in my favor if there’s an extra dollar being delivered here or there. If there’s some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won’t even mention it to me. Because he goes so far out of his way to treat me so well, I send him every deal I have—I try to include him in everything. Then, I go out of my way to try and pay for him. Compounding in those relationships is very valuable. [10]
我喜欢和埃拉德一起工作，因为我知道当交易完成时，他会竭尽全力给我额外的报酬。如果这里或那里多出一美元，他总是会对我有利的。如果要付一些费用，他会自掏腰包，他甚至不会跟我提这件事。因为他不遗余力地对我如此好，我把我的每一笔交易都寄给他-我试着把他包括在每一件事上。然后，我不厌其烦地试着为他付钱。在这些关系中进行复利是非常有价值的。

Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.
意图并不重要。行动能做到这一点。这就是为什么道德是很难做到的。

When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important. [10]
当你找到要做的正确事情时，当你找到合适的人一起工作时，进行深度投资。坚持几十年是你在人际关系和金钱中获得巨大回报的真正方式。因此，复利非常重要。“[10]
99% of effort is wasted.
99%的努力都白费了。

Obviously, nothing is ever completely wasted because it’s all a learning moment. You can learn from anything. But for example, when you go back to school, 99 percent of the term papers you did, books you read, exercises you did, things you learned, they don’t really apply. You might have read geography and history you never reuse. You might have studied a language you don’t speak anymore. You might have studied a branch of mathematics you completely forgot.
显然，没有什么是完全浪费的，因为这都是一个学习的时刻。你可以从任何事情中学习。但是，例如，当你回到学校时，你做的99%的学期论文，你读的书，你做的练习，你学到的东西，它们并不真正适用。你可能读过从未重复使用过的地理和历史。你可能学过一门你不再会说的语言。你可能学过一门你完全忘记的数学分支。

Of course, these are learning experiences. You did learn. You learned the value of hard work; you might have learned something that went deep into your psyche and became a piece of what you’re doing now. But at least when it comes to the goal -oriented life, only about 1 percent of the efforts you made paid off.
当然，这些都是学习的经历。你确实学到了。你学到了努力工作的价值；你可能学到了一些东西，这些东西深入你的心灵，成为你现在正在做的事情的一部分。但至少在以目标为导向的生活中，你所做的努力只有1%得到了回报。

Another example is all the people you dated until you met your husband or wife. It was wasted time in the goal sense. Not wasted in the exponential sense, not wasted in the learning sense, but definitely wasted in the goal sense.
另一个例子是所有你约会过的人，直到你遇到你的丈夫或妻子。这是在目标意义上浪费时间。不是指数意义上的浪费，不是学习意义上的浪费，而是目标意义上的绝对浪费。

The reason I say this is not to make some glib comment about how 99 percent of your life is wasted and only 1 percent is useful. I say this because you should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you’re trying to do is find the thing you can go all -in on to earn compound interest.
我这么说的原因不是要对你99%的生命是如何浪费的，只有1%是有用的，做些油嘴滑舌的评论。我这么说是因为你应该非常深思熟虑，在大多数事情上(人际关系、工作，甚至是学习)都应该意识到，你要做的是找到你可以全力以赴赚取复利的东西。

When you’re dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you’re studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It’s a waste of time. It’s a waste of your brain energy.
当你在约会的时候，当你知道这段关系不会导致婚姻的那一刻，你可能就应该向前看了。当你在学习一些东西时，比如地理或历史课，你意识到你永远不会用到这些信息，那就放弃这门课。纯属浪费时间。这是在浪费你的脑力。

I’m not saying don’t do the 99 percent, because it’s very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I’m saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you’ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all -in and forget about the rest. [10]
我不是说不要做99%，因为很难确定1%是什么。我的意思是：当你发现你的1%的纪律不会被浪费，你将能够在你的余生中投资，并且对你有意义--全力以赴，忘掉其余的。
