 Part II : Happiness
第二部分：幸福
The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.

人生的三大要素是财富、健康和幸福。我们按照这个顺序追求它们，但它们的重要性是相反的。


 Learning Happiness
学习快乐
Don’t take yourself so seriously. You’re just a monkey with a plan.

别把自己看得太重了。你只是一只有计划的猴子。

 Happiness Is Learned
幸福是后天学来的
Ten years ago, if you would have asked me how happy I was, I would have dismissed the question. I didn’t want to talk about it.

十年前，如果你问我有多幸福，我会不屑一顾。我不想谈这件事。

On a scale of 1–10, I would have said 2/10 or 3/10. Maybe 4/10 on my best days. But I did not value being happy.

如果从1到10分，我会说2/10或3/10。在我最好的时候可能是十分之四。但我并不看重快乐。

Today, I am a 9/10. And yes, having money helps, but it’s actually a very small piece of it. Most of it comes from learning over the years my own happiness is the most important thing to me, and I’ve cultivated it with a lot of techniques. [10]
今天，我是9/10。是的，有钱是有帮助的，但实际上这只是其中很小的一部分。这些年来我学到了很多，我自己的快乐对我来说是最重要的，我用很多技巧培养了它。

Maybe happiness is not something you inherit or even choose, but a highly personal skill that can be learned, like fitness or nutrition.

也许幸福不是你继承的，甚至不是你选择的，而是一种高度个人化的技能，可以学习，比如健身或营养。

Happiness is a very evolving thing, I think, like all the great questions. When you’re a little kid, you go to your mom and ask, “What happens when we die? Is there a Santa Claus? Is there a God? Should I be happy? Who should I marry?” Those kinds of things. There are no glib answers because no answers apply to everybody. These kinds of questions ultimately do have answers, but they have personal answers.

我认为，幸福是一个非常进化的东西，就像所有伟大的问题一样。当你还是个小孩子的时候，你去找你妈妈问，“我们死后会发生什么？”有圣诞老人吗？真的有上帝吗？我应该高兴吗？我该嫁给谁呢？“诸如此类的事情。没有圆滑的答案，因为没有答案适用于每个人。这类问题最终确实有答案，但它们有个人的答案。

The answer that works for me is going to be nonsense to you, and vice versa. Whatever happiness means to me, it means something different to you. I think it’s very important to explore what these definitions are.

对我有效的答案对你来说是无稽之谈，反之亦然。无论幸福对我意味着什么，它对你都意味着不同的东西。我认为探索这些定义是非常重要的。

For some people I know, it’s a flow state. For some people, it’s satisfaction. For some people, it’s a feeling of contentment. My definition keeps evolving. The answer I would have given you a year ago will be different than what I tell you now.

对我认识的一些人来说，这是一种流动状态。对一些人来说，这是一种满足。对一些人来说，这是一种满足感。我的定义在不断演变。一年前我会给你的答案将与我现在告诉你的不同。

Today, I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.

今天，我相信幸福真的是一种默认状态。当你去除生活中缺失的东西时，幸福就在那里。

We are highly judgmental survival -and -replication machines. We constantly walk around thinking, “I need this,” or “I need that,” trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something.

我们是具有高度判断力的生存和复制机器。我们不停地走来走去，想着“我需要这个”或“我需要那个”，困在欲望的网中。幸福是什么都不缺的状态。当什么都没有丢失的时候，你的大脑就会关闭，不再追忆过去或未来，后悔或计划一些事情。

In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content, and you are happy. Feel free to disagree. Again, it’s different for everybody.

在这种缺席的情况下，有一段时间，你内心保持沉默。当你内心沉默时，你就满足了，你就快乐了。你可以不同意我的观点。同样，这对每个人来说都是不同的。

People mistakenly believe happiness is just about positive thoughts and positive actions. The more I’ve read, the more I’ve learned, and the more I’ve experienced (because I verify this for myself), every positive thought essentially holds within it a negative thought. It is a contrast to something negative. The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all duality and polarity. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.

人们错误地认为幸福就是积极的想法和积极的行动。我读得越多，学到的就越多，经历的也越多(因为我自己证实了这一点)，每一个积极的想法基本上都包含着消极的想法。这与一些负面的东西形成了鲜明的对比。“道德经”比我说得更清楚，但这都是二元性和极性。如果我说我很开心，那就意味着我在某个时候很难过。如果我说他有吸引力，那么其他人就没有吸引力了。每一个积极的思想甚至都包含着消极思想的种子，反之亦然，这就是为什么生活中的许多伟大都是从苦难中产生的。你必须先看到消极的一面，然后才能向往和欣赏积极的一面。

To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto a feeling, if I say, “Oh, I’m happy now,” and I want to stay happy, then I’m going to drop out of that happiness. Now, suddenly, the mind is moving. It’s trying to attach to something. It’s trying to create a permanent situation out of a temporary situation.

对我来说，幸福不是积极的想法。这不是关于消极的想法。它是关于欲望的缺失，特别是对外部事物的欲望的缺失。我的欲望越少，我就越能接受现在的状态，我的心就越不动，因为心确实存在于朝向未来或过去的运动中。我现在过得越多，我就会越快乐、越满足。如果我抓住一种感觉，如果我说，“哦，我现在很快乐，”我想保持快乐，那么我就会放弃那种快乐。现在，突然之间，思想在移动。它试图附着在什么东西上。它试图在暂时的情况下创造一个永久性的情况。

Happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is, and the way it is. [4]
对我来说，幸福主要是不受苦，不欲望，不想太多未来或过去，真正拥抱现在的时刻和现实，以及它现在的样子。

If you ever want to have peace in your life, you have to move beyond good and evil.

如果你想在你的生活中拥有和平，你必须超越善恶。

Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire. [4]
大自然没有幸福或不幸的概念。从宇宙大爆炸到现在，自然界遵循着一成不变的数学定律和一连串的因果关系。一切都是完美的，就像它原来的样子。只有在我们特定的头脑中，我们才会不快乐或不快乐，事情是完美的还是不完美的，因为我们想要什么。

The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there is no concept of right or wrong, good or bad. You’re born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations (lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. How you choose to interpret them is up to you—you have that choice.

这个世界只是把你自己的感觉反映在你身上。现实是中立的。现实是没有评判的。对于一棵树来说，没有对与错、好与坏的概念。你出生了，你有一整套的感官体验和刺激(光、颜色和声音)，然后你就死了。你如何选择解释它们是你自己的事--你有这个选择。

This is what I mean when I say happiness is a choice. If you believe it’s a choice, you can start working on it. [77]
这就是我说幸福是一种选择的意思。如果你认为这是一个选择，你就可以开始努力了。

There are no external forces affecting your emotions—as much as it may feel that way.

没有任何外部力量会影响你的情绪--尽管它可能感觉如此。

I’ve also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self, and I think that helps a lot. For example, if you thought you were the most important thing in the Universe, then you would have to bend the entire Universe to your will. If you’re the most important thing in the Universe, then how could it not conform to your desires. If it doesn’t conform to your desires, something is wrong.

我也开始相信自我是完全无关紧要的，我认为这很有帮助。例如，如果你认为你是宇宙中最重要的东西，那么你将不得不让整个宇宙屈从于你的意志。如果你是宇宙中最重要的东西，那么它怎么会不符合你的愿望呢？如果它不符合你的愿望，那就是出了问题。

However, if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba—or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should “actually” be. Life is just the way it is. When you accept that, you have no cause to be happy or unhappy. Those things almost don’t apply.

然而，如果你认为自己是细菌或变形虫，或者你认为你所有的作品都是在水上写字或在沙子上建造城堡，那么你就不会对生活应该是怎样的“实际”抱有任何期望。生活就是这样。当你接受这一点时，你就没有理由快乐或不快乐。这些东西几乎不适用。

Happiness is what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life.

幸福就是当你去除生活中缺失的感觉时所拥有的东西。

What you’re left with in that neutral state is not neutrality. I think people believe neutrality would be a very bland existence. No, this is the existence little children live. If you look at little children, on balance, they’re generally pretty happy because they are really immersed in the environment and the moment, without any thought of how it should be given their personal preferences and desires. I think the neutral state is actually a perfection state. One can be very happy as long as one isn’t too caught up in their own head. [4]
在这种中立状态下，你剩下的不是中立。我认为人们认为中立会是一种非常平淡的生活。不，这是小孩子的生活方式。如果你看看小孩子，总的来说，他们通常都很快乐，因为他们真的沉浸在环境和时刻中，没有考虑应该如何给予他们个人的偏好和愿望。我认为中性状态实际上是一种完美状态。只要一个人不太沉迷于自己的头脑，他就可以非常快乐。

Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You’re just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute, which doesn’t mean you chase some stupid desire for your entire life. What it means is every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way. [9]
我们的生活就像一只夜里的萤火虫在眨眼。你只是勉强站在这里。你必须充分利用每一分钟，这并不意味着你一生都在追逐一些愚蠢的愿望。这意味着你在这个星球上的每一秒都是非常宝贵的，你有责任确保你是快乐的，并以尽可能好的方式解释一切。

We think of ourselves as fixed and the world as malleable, but it’s really we who are malleable and the world is largely fixed.

我们认为自己是固定的，世界是可塑的，但实际上是我们是可塑的，世界在很大程度上是固定的。

Can practicing meditation help you accept reality?
练习冥想能帮助你接受现实吗？
Yeah. But it’s amazing how little it helps. [laughs] You can be a long -time meditator, but if someone says the wrong thing in the wrong way, you go back to your ego -driven self. It’s almost like you’re lifting one -pound weights, but then somebody drops a huge barbell with a stack of plates on your head.

嗯。但令人惊讶的是，它的帮助如此之小。[笑]你可以成为一名长期的冥想者，但如果有人用错误的方式说错了话，你就会回到自我驱使的自我。这几乎就像你在举起一磅的重量，但然后有人掉下一个巨大的杠铃，上面有一堆盘子放在你的头上。

It’s absolutely better than doing nothing. But when the actual moment of mental or emotional suffering arrives, it’s still never easy. [8] Real happiness only comes as a side -effect of peace. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment. [8]
这绝对比什么都不做要好。但是，当精神或情感痛苦的真实时刻到来时，这仍然不是一件容易的事。真正的幸福只是和平带来的副作用。其中大部分将来自接受，而不是来自改变你的外部环境。

A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control.

一个理性的人可以通过培养对他们无法控制的事物的冷漠来找到平静。

I have lowered my identity.

我降低了我的身份。

I have lowered the chattering of my mind.

我已经降低了脑海中的喋喋不休。

I don’t care about things that don’t really matter.

我不关心那些无关紧要的事情。

I don’t get involved in politics.

我不参与政治。

I don’t hang around unhappy people.

我不会和不开心的人混在一起。

I really value my time on this earth.

我真的很珍惜我在这个世界上的时间。

I read philosophy.

我读哲学。

I meditate.

我在冥想。

I hang around with happy people.

我和快乐的人在一起。

And it works.

它起作用了。

You can very slowly but steadily and methodically improve your happiness baseline, just like you can improve your fitness. [10]
你可以非常缓慢地、稳定地、有条不紊地提高你的幸福基线，就像你可以提高你的体能一样。

 Happiness Is a Choice
幸福是一种选择
Happiness, love, and passion…aren’t things you find—they’re choices you make.

幸福、爱情和激情…不是你找到的东西-它们是你做出的选择。

Happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop.

幸福是你做出的选择，是你发展起来的技能。

The mind is just as malleable as the body. We spend so much time and effort trying to change the external world, other people, and our own bodies—all while accepting ourselves the way we were programmed in our youths.

头脑和身体一样具有可塑性。我们花费了如此多的时间和精力试图改变外部世界、他人和我们自己的身体--所有这些都是在接受我们自己在年轻时被编程的方式的同时。

We accept the voice in our head as the source of all truth. But all of it is malleable, and every day is new. Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present. [3]
我们接受头脑中的声音，认为它是一切真理的源泉。但所有这些都是可塑性的，每天都是新的。记忆和身份是来自过去的负担，阻碍了我们自由地生活在现在。

 Happiness Requires Presence
幸福需要在场
At any given time, when you’re walking down the streets, a very small percentage of your brain is focused on the present. The rest is planning the future or regretting the past. This keeps you from having an incredible experience. It’s keeping you from seeing the beauty in everything and for being grateful for where you are. You can literally destroy your happiness if you spend all of your time living in delusions of the future. [4]
在任何给定的时间，当你走在街上时，你的大脑只有很小一部分专注于现在。剩下的要么是规划未来，要么是后悔过去。这会让你不会有不可思议的体验。它让你看不到每件事的美好，也让你不能对自己所处的位置心存感激。如果你把所有的时间都生活在对未来的幻想中，你可能真的会毁了你的幸福。

We crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.

我们渴望能让我们活在当下的体验，但这些渴望本身就会把我们从当下带走。

I just don’t believe in anything from my past. Anything. No memories. No regrets. No people. No trips. Nothing. A lot of our unhappiness comes from comparing things from the past to the present. [4]
我只是不相信我过去的任何事。什么都行。没有记忆。无怨无悔。没有人。没有旅行。没什么。我们的很多不快乐来自于将过去的事情与现在的事情进行比较。

Anticipation for our vices pulls us into the future. Eliminating vices makes it easier to be present.

对我们恶行的期待把我们拉向未来。消除恶习会让你更容易活在当下。

There’s a great definition I read: “Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts.” It means enlightenment isn’t something you achieve after thirty years sitting on a mountaintop. It’s something you can achieve moment to moment, and you can be enlightened to a certain percent every single day. [5]
我读到了一个很棒的定义：“开悟是你思想之间的空间。”这意味着开悟不是你坐在山顶上三十年后才能实现的东西。这是一件你可以时时刻刻都能做到的事情，你每天都可以得到一定的启发。“[5]
What if this life is the paradise we were promised, and we’re just squandering it?
如果这种生活就是我们被许诺的天堂，而我们只是在浪费它呢？
 Happiness Requires Peace
幸福需要和平
Are happiness and purpose interconnected?
幸福和目标是相互联系的吗？
Happiness is such an overloaded word, I’m not even sure what it means. For me these days, happiness is more about peace than it is about joy. I don’t think peace and purpose go together.

幸福是一个超负荷的词，我甚至不确定它是什么意思。这些天来，对我来说，幸福更多的是关于和平，而不是快乐。我不认为和平和目标是相辅相成的。

If it’s your internal purpose, the thing you most want to do, then sure, you’ll be happy doing it. But an externally inflicted purpose, like “society wants me to do X,” “I am the first son of the first son of this, so I should do Y,” or “I have this debt or burden I took on,” I don’t think it will make you happy.

如果这是你的内在目标，你最想做的事情，那么当然，你会很乐意去做的。但是一个外在的目的，比如“社会想让我做X”，“我是这个第一个儿子的长子，所以我应该做Y”，或者“我承担了这个债务或负担”，我认为这不会让你开心。

I think a lot of us have this low -level pervasive feeling of anxiety. If you pay attention to your mind, sometimes you’re just running around doing your thing and you’re not feeling great, and you notice your mind is chattering and chattering about something. Maybe you can’t sit still…There’s this “nexting” thing where you’re sitting in one spot thinking about where you should be next.

我想我们很多人都有这种低水平的无处不在的焦虑感。如果你注意你的思想，有时你只是在做你的事情，感觉不是很好，你会注意到你的思想在不停地谈论着什么。也许你坐不住了，…有一种“紧要关头”的事情，你坐在一个位置上思考下一步该去哪里。

It’s always the next thing, then the next thing, the next thing after that, then the next thing after that creating this pervasive anxiety.

总是下一件事，然后是那之后的下一件事，这造成了这种无处不在的焦虑。

It’s most obvious if you ever just sit down and try and do nothing, nothing. I mean nothing, I mean not read a book, I mean not listen to music, I mean literally just sit down and do nothing. You can’t do it, because there’s anxiety always trying to make you get up and go, get up and go, get up and go. I think it’s important just being aware the anxiety is making you unhappy. The anxiety is just a series of running thoughts.

最明显的是，如果你只是坐下来，什么都不做，什么都不做。我的意思是什么也不是，我的意思是不看书，不听音乐，我的意思是坐下来什么都不做。你做不到，因为焦虑总是试图让你站起来走，站起来走，站起来走。我认为意识到焦虑让你不开心是很重要的。焦虑只是一系列奔跑的想法。

How I combat anxiety: I don’t try and fight it, I just notice I’m anxious because of all these thoughts. I try to figure out, “Would I rather be having this thought right now, or would I rather have my peace?” Because as long as I have my thoughts, I can’t have my peace.

我如何对抗焦虑：我没有试图与之抗争，我只是注意到我因为所有这些想法而焦虑。我试图弄清楚，“我是宁愿现在就有这样的想法，还是宁愿得到安宁？”因为只要我有我的想法，我就不会安宁。

You’ll notice when I say happiness, I mean peace. When a lot of people say happiness, they mean joy or bliss, but I’ll take peace. [2]
你会注意到当我说幸福的时候，我的意思是和平。当很多人说幸福时，他们的意思是快乐或幸福，但我会平静下来。

A happy person isn’t someone who’s happy all the time.

快乐的人不是一直快乐的人。

It’s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don’t lose their innate peace.

它是这样一个人，他毫不费力地用这样一种方式来解释事件，使他们不会失去与生俱来的宁静。


 Every Desire Is a Chosen Unhappiness
每一个欲望都是一种选择的不快乐
I think the most common mistake for humanity is believing you’re going to be made happy because of some external circumstance. I know that’s not original. That’s not new. It’s fundamental Buddhist wisdom—I’m not taking credit for it. I think I really just recognize it on a fundamental level, including in myself.

我认为人类最常见的错误是相信你会因为一些外部环境而感到幸福。我知道这不是原创。这不是什么新鲜事。这是佛教的基本智慧--我不会因此而受到赞扬。我想我只是从根本上认识到了这一点，包括我自己。

We bought a new car. Now, I’m waiting for the new car to arrive. Of course, every night, I’m on the forums reading about the car. Why? It’s a silly object. It’s a silly car. It’s not going to change my life much or at all. I know the instant the car arrives I won’t care about it anymore. The thing is, I’m addicted to the desiring. I’m addicted to the idea of this external thing bringing me some kind of happiness and joy, and this is completely delusional.

我们买了一辆新车。现在，我在等新车的到来。当然，每天晚上，我都会在论坛上读到关于这辆车的报道。为什么？这是个愚蠢的东西。这是一辆愚蠢的车。它不会改变我的生活很多，或者根本不会改变我的生活。我知道车一到，我就不会再管它了。问题是，我沉迷于欲望。我沉迷于这种外在的东西给我带来某种幸福和快乐的想法，这完全是妄想。

Looking outside yourself for anything is the fundamental delusion. Not to say you shouldn’t do things on the outside. You absolutely should. You’re a living creature. There are things you do. You locally reverse entropy. That’s why you’re here.

在自己之外寻找任何东西都是根本的错觉。并不是说你不应该在外面做事情。你绝对应该这么做。你是个活生生的生物。有些事情是你做的。你在局部反熵。这就是你在这里的原因。

You’re meant to do something. You’re not just meant to lie there in the sand and meditate all day long. You should self -actualize . You should do what you are meant to do.

你注定要做些什么。你不应该整天躺在沙滩上冥想。你应该自我实现。你应该做你应该做的事。

The idea you’re going to change something in the outside world, and that is going to bring you the peace, everlasting joy, and happiness you deserve, is a fundamental delusion we all suffer from, including me. The mistake over and over and over is to say, “Oh, I’ll be happy when I get that thing,” whatever it is. That is the fundamental mistake we all make, 24/7, all day long. [4]
你想要改变外面世界的一些东西，这会给你带来你应得的和平、永恒的快乐和幸福，这是我们所有人都在遭受的根本错觉，包括我在内。一遍又一遍的错误是说，“哦，当我得到那个东西的时候我会很高兴的”，不管是什么东西。这是我们全天候、全天候都会犯的根本性错误。

The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.

根本的错觉是：总有一些东西会让我永远快乐和满足。

Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. I don’t think most of us realize that’s what it is. I think we go about desiring things all day long and then wonder why we’re unhappy. I like to stay aware of it, because then I can choose my desires very carefully. I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize it as the axis of my suffering. I realize the area where I’ve chosen to be unhappy. [5]
欲望是你与自己签订的一份协议，在你得到你想要的东西之前，你不会感到幸福。我想我们大多数人都没有意识到事情就是这样。我想我们整天都在想着想要的东西，然后想知道为什么我们不快乐。我喜欢意识到这一点，因为这样我就可以非常谨慎地选择我的欲望。在任何给定的时间里，我尽量不在我的生活中有一个以上的大愿望，我也认识到它是我痛苦的轴心。我意识到我选择了不快乐的领域。

Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

欲望是你与自己签订的一份协议，在你得到你想要的东西之前，你不会感到幸福。

One thing I’ve learned recently: it’s way more important to perfect your desires than to try to do something you don’t 100 percent desire. [1]
我最近学到了一件事：完善你的愿望比尝试做一些你不是百分之百渴望的事情要重要得多。

When you’re young and healthy, you can do more. By doing more, you’re actually taking on more and more desires. You don’t realize this is slowly destroying your happiness. I find younger people are less happy but more healthy. Older people are more happy but less healthy.

当你年轻健康的时候，你可以做更多的事情。通过做更多的事情，你实际上承担了越来越多的欲望。你没有意识到这正在慢慢毁掉你的幸福。我发现年轻人不那么快乐，但更健康。年纪大的人更快乐，但不太健康。

When you’re young, you have time. You have health, but you have no money. When you’re middle -aged , you have money and you have health, but you have no time. When you’re old, you have money and you have time, but you have no health. So the trifecta is trying to get all three at once.

当你年轻的时候，你有时间。你很健康，但是你没有钱。当你到了中年，你有钱，你有健康，但是你没有时间。当你老了，你有钱，你有时间，但是你没有健康。因此，三连胜试图同时实现这三个目标。

By the time people realize they have enough money, they’ve lost their time and their health. [8]
当人们意识到他们有足够的钱时，他们已经失去了时间和健康。

 Success Does Not Earn Happiness
成功不会带来幸福
Happiness is being satisfied with what you have.

幸福就是满足于你所拥有的。

Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.

成功来自不满。选择吧。

Confucius says you have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one. When and how did your second life begin?
孔子说人有两种生活，当你意识到自己只有一种生活时，第二种生活就开始了。你的第二次生命是什么时候开始的，又是如何开始的？
That’s a very deep question. Most people who are past a certain age have had this feeling or phenomenon; they’ve gone through life a certain way and then gotten to a certain stage and had to make some pretty big changes. I’m definitely also in that boat.

这是一个非常深刻的问题。大多数过了一定年龄的人都有过这种感觉或现象，他们经历了一定的人生道路，然后到了一定的阶段，不得不做出一些相当大的改变。我肯定也在那条船上。

I struggled for a lot of my life to have certain material and social successes. When I achieved those material and social successes (or at least was beyond a point where they didn’t matter as much), I realized the people around me who had achieved similar successes and were on their way to achieving more didn’t seem all that happy. In my case, there was definitely hedonic adaptation: I’d very quickly get used to anything.

为了取得一定的物质和社会成就，我一生中奋斗了很长一段时间。当我取得那些物质上和社会上的成功(或者至少超过了不重要的程度)时，我意识到我周围那些取得了类似成功并正在取得更多成就的人似乎并不那么快乐。在我的例子中，肯定有享乐主义的适应：我很快就会习惯任何事情。

This led me to the conclusion, which seems trite, that happiness is internal. That conclusion set me on a path of working more on my internal self and realizing all real success is internal and has very little to do with external circumstances.

这让我得出了一个似乎陈词滥调的结论，那就是幸福是内在的。这个结论让我走上了一条更多地关注内在自我的道路，并意识到所有真正的成功都是内在的，与外部环境几乎没有什么关系。

One has to do the external thing anyway. We’re biologically hard -wired . It’s glib to say, “You can just turn it off.” Your own life experience will bring you back to the internal path. [7]
一个人无论如何都要做外部的事情。我们生来就是天生的。说：“你可以把它关掉，这太油嘴滑舌了。”你自己的生活经历会把你带回内在的道路。

The problem with getting good at a game, especially one with big rewards, is you continue playing it long after you should have outgrown it.

擅长一款游戏，尤其是一款回报丰厚的游戏，其问题在于，在你本该玩得远远不够的情况下，你还要继续玩很长一段时间。

Survival and replication drive put us on the work treadmill. Hedonic adaptation keeps us there. The trick is knowing when to jump off and play instead.

生存和复制的驱动力把我们推上了工作的跑步机。享乐适应让我们保持在那里。诀窍是知道什么时候跳下来玩。

Who do you think of as successful?
你认为谁是成功的呢？
Most people think of someone as successful when they win a game, whatever game they play themselves. If you’re an athlete, you’re going to think of a top athlete. If you’re in business, you might think Elon Musk.

大多数人认为一个人在赢得一场比赛时是成功的，无论他们自己玩什么游戏。如果你是一名运动员，你会想到一位顶尖的运动员。如果你在做生意，你可能会认为埃隆·马斯克。

A few years ago, I would have said Steve Jobs, because he was part of the driving force creating something that changed lives for all of humanity. I think Marc Andreessen is successful, not because of his recent incarnation as a venture capitalist, but because of the incredible work he did with Netscape. Satoshi Nakamoto is successful in that he created Bitcoin, which is this incredible technological creation that will have repercussions for decades to come. Of course, Elon Musk, because he changed everyone’s viewpoint on what is possible with modern technology and entrepreneurship. I consider those creators and commercializers successful.

几年前，我会说史蒂夫·乔布斯，因为他是创造改变全人类生活的东西的推动力的一部分。我认为马克·安德森是成功的，不是因为他最近化身为一名风险资本家，而是因为他在网景公司所做的令人难以置信的工作。中本聪(Satoshi Nakamoto)的成功之处在于他创造了比特币，这是一项令人难以置信的技术创造，将在未来几十年内产生影响。当然，埃隆·马斯克，因为他改变了每个人对现代技术和企业家精神的可能性的看法。我认为那些创造者和商业化者是成功的。

To me, the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don’t even play the game, who rise above it. Those are the people who have such internal mental and self -control and self -awareness , they need nothing from anybody else. There are a couple of these characters I know in my life. Jerzy Gregorek—I would consider him successful because he doesn’t need anything from anybody. He’s at peace, he’s healthy, and whether he makes more money or less money compared to the next person has no effect on his mental state.

对我来说，真正的赢家是那些完全退出游戏的人，那些甚至不玩游戏的人，那些超越游戏的人。他们就是那些拥有内在精神、自我控制和自我意识的人，他们不需要任何其他人的帮助。在我的生活中，我认识几个这样的角色。杰齐·格雷戈雷克-我认为他是成功的，因为他不需要从任何人那里得到任何东西。他很平静，他很健康，与下一个人相比，他赚的钱多还是少都不会影响他的精神状态。

Historically, I would say the legendary Buddha or Krishnamurti, whose stuff I like reading, they are successful in the sense that they step out of the game entirely. Winning or losing does not matter to them.

从历史上看，我会说传奇的佛陀或克里希那穆提，我喜欢读他们的作品，他们是成功的，因为他们完全退出了游戏。输赢对他们来说无关紧要。

There’s a line from Blaise Pascal I read. Basically, it says: “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself.” If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there. [6]
我读过布莱斯·帕斯卡的一句话。基本上，它说的是：“人类所有的烦恼都是因为他不能一个人安静地坐在房间里。”如果你能坐上三十分钟快乐地坐着，你就成功了。这是一个非常强大的地方，但我们中很少有人能做到这一点。

I think of happiness as an emergent property of peace. If you’re peaceful inside and out, that will eventually result in happiness. But peace is a very hard thing to come by. The irony is the way most of us try to find peace is through war. When you start a business, in a way, you’re going to war. When you struggle with your roommates as to who should clean the dishes, you’re going to war. You’re struggling so you can have some sense of security and peace later.

我认为幸福是和平的一种紧急属性。如果你内心平和，那最终会带来幸福。但和平来之不易。具有讽刺意味的是，我们大多数人试图通过战争找到和平的方式。当你开始创业时，从某种意义上说，你就是在打仗。当你和室友争执谁该洗碗的时候，你就要开战了。你在苦苦挣扎，这样你以后才能有安全感和宁静感。

In reality, peace is not a guarantee. It’s always flowing. It’s always changing. You want to learn the core skill set of flowing with life and accepting it in most cases. [8]
在现实中，和平并不是保证。它总是在流动。它总是在变。你想要学习的核心技能是随波逐流，并在大多数情况下接受生活。

You can get almost anything you want out of life, as long as it’s one thing and you want it far more than anything else.

你几乎可以从生活中得到你想要的任何东西，只要这是一件事，而且你想要的远远超过其他任何东西。

In my own personal experience, the place I end up the most is wanting to be at peace.

在我个人的经验中，我最终最想去的地方就是想要安宁。

Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want. But peace is what you want most of the time. If you’re a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity.

和平是安息的幸福，幸福是运动中的和平。你可以在任何你想要的时候把和平转化为幸福。但大多数时候，和平才是你想要的。如果你是一个平和的人，你做的任何事情都将是一项快乐的活动。

Today, the way we think you get peace is by resolving all your external problems. But there are unlimited external problems. The only way to actually get peace on the inside is by giving up this idea of problems. [77]
今天，我们认为你们获得和平的方式是通过解决你们所有的外部问题。但也有无限的外部问题。真正获得内心和平的唯一方法就是放弃这种对问题的想法。“[77]
 Envy Is the Enemy of Happiness
嫉妒是幸福的敌人
I don’t think life is that hard. I think we make it hard. One of the things I’m trying to get rid of is the word “should.” Whenever the word “should” creeps up in your mind, it’s guilt or social programming. Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate as many “shoulds” from my life as possible. [1]
我不认为生活有那么难。我想我们让事情变得困难了。我想要摆脱的一件事是“应该”这个词。每当“应该”这个词悄悄出现在你的脑海中时，它就是内疚或社交程序。因为你“应该”而做某事基本上意味着你实际上并不想去做。这只会让你很痛苦，所以我试图从我的生活中尽可能多地剔除“应该”。

The enemy of peace of mind is expectations drilled into you by society and other people.

心灵安宁的敌人是社会和其他人灌输给你的期望。

Socially, we’re told, “Go work out. Go look good.” That’s a multi -player competitive game. Other people can see if I’m doing a good job or not. We’re told, “Go make money. Go buy a big house.” Again, external multiplayer competitive game. Training yourself to be happy is completely internal. There is no external progress, no external validation. You’re competing against yourself—it is a single -player game.

在社交方面，我们被告知，“去锻炼吧。好好打扮一下吧。“这是一个多人竞争的游戏。其他人可以看到我做得好不好。我们被告知，“去赚钱吧。去买一栋大房子吧。“再说一遍，外部多人竞技游戏。训练自己快乐完全是内在的。没有外部进展，没有外部验证。你在和你自己竞争--这是一场单人游戏。

We’re like bees or ants. We are such social creatures, we’re externally programmed and driven. We don’t know how to play and win these single -player games anymore. We compete purely in multiplayer games.

我们就像蜜蜂或蚂蚁。我们是这样的社会性生物，我们被外部编程和驱使。我们再也不知道如何玩和赢得这些单人游戏了。我们纯粹是在多人游戏中竞争。

The reality is life is a single -player game. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You’re gone in three generations, and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single player.

现实是，生活是一场单人游戏。你生来就是孤身一人。你会孤身一人死去。你所有的解释都是单独的。你所有的记忆都是孤独的。再过三代你就走了，没人在乎。在你出现之前，没人在乎。都是单人游戏。

Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is they have no extrinsic value. Purely single -player games.

也许瑜伽和冥想难以持续的原因之一是它们没有外在价值。纯粹的单人游戏。

Buffett has a great example when he asks if you want to be the world’s best lover and known as the worst, or the world’s worst lover and known as the best? [paraphrased] in reference to an inner or external scorecard.

巴菲特有一个很好的例子，当他问你是想成为世界上最好的情人，被称为最糟糕的，还是世界上最糟糕的情人，被称为最好的？[释义]指的是内部或外部记分卡。

Exactly right. All the real scorecards are internal.

完全正确。所有真正的记分卡都是内部的。

Jealousy was a very hard emotion for me to overcome. When I was young, I had a lot of jealousy. By and by, I learned to get rid of it. It still crops up every now and then. It’s such a poisonous emotion because, at the end of the day, you’re no better off with jealousy. You’re unhappier, and the person you’re jealous of is still successful or good -looking or whatever they are.

嫉妒对我来说是一种很难克服的情绪。当我年轻的时候，我有很多嫉妒。渐渐地，我学会了摆脱它。它仍然时不时地冒出来。这是一种非常有害的情绪，因为在一天结束的时候，嫉妒并不会让你过得更好。你变得更不快乐了，而你嫉妒的那个人仍然是成功的或者英俊的，或者不管他们是什么。

One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self -image ? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.

有一天，我意识到，和所有这些我嫉妒的人在一起，我不能只选择他们生活中的一些小方面。我不能说我想要他的身体，我想要她的钱，我想要他的个性。你必须成为那个人。你真的想成为那个拥有他们所有的反应，他们的欲望，他们的家庭，他们的幸福水平，他们的人生观，他们的自我形象的人吗？如果你不愿意全天候、百分之百地与那个人交换，那么嫉妒是没有意义的。

Once I came to that realization, jealousy faded away because I don’t want to be anybody else. I’m perfectly happy being me. By the way, even that is under my control. To be happy being me. It’s just there are no social rewards for it. [4]
一旦我意识到这一点，嫉妒就消失了，因为我不想成为其他任何人。我非常乐意做我自己。顺便说一下，就连那也在我的控制之下。快乐地做我自己。这只是因为它没有社会回报。“[4]
 Happiness Is Built by Habits
幸福是由习惯造就的。

My most surprising discovery in the last five years is that peace and happiness are skills. These are not things you are born with. Yes, there is a genetic range. And a lot of it is conditioning from your environment, but you can un -condition and recondition yourself.

在过去的五年里，我最令人惊讶的发现是，和平和幸福是技能。这些不是你生来就有的东西。是的，这是有遗传范围的。其中很大一部分是来自你的环境的条件作用，但是你可以取消条件，重新调整自己。

You can increase your happiness over time, and it starts with believing you can do it.

随着时间的推移，你可以增加你的幸福感，它始于相信你能做到。

It’s a skill. Just like nutrition is a skill, dieting is a skill, working out is a skill, making money is a skill, meeting girls and guys is a skill, having good relationships is a skill, even love is a skill. It starts with realizing they’re skills you can learn. When you put your intention and focus on it, the world can become a better place.

这是一种技能。就像营养是一种技能，节食是一种技能，锻炼是一种技能，赚钱是一种技能，结识女孩和男孩是一种技能，拥有良好的关系是一种技能，甚至爱情也是一种技能。首先要认识到它们是你可以学习的技能。当你用心并专注于它时，世界就会变得更美好。

When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you.

工作时，与比你更成功的人在一起。

When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you.

玩的时候，让自己周围都是比你快乐的人。

What type of skill is happiness?
幸福是一种什么样的技能？
It’s all trial and error. You just see what works. You can try sitting meditation. Did that work for you? Was it Tantra meditation or was it Vipassana meditation? Was it a ten -day retreat or was twenty minutes enough?
这都是试错。你只要看看什么管用就行了。你可以试试坐着冥想。这对你管用吗？是密宗打坐还是内观打坐？这是十天的静修，还是二十分钟就够了？
Okay. None of those worked. But what if I tried yoga? What if I kite -surfed ? What if I go car racing? What about cooking? Does that make me Zen? You literally have to try all of these things until you find something that works for you.

好吧。这些都不管用。但是如果我试试瑜伽呢？如果我玩风筝冲浪呢？如果我去赛车呢？那做饭呢？那我就是禅宗了吗？你必须尝试所有这些方法，直到你找到适合你的东西。

When it comes to medicines for the mind, the placebo effect is 100 percent effective. When it comes to your mind, you want to be positively inclined, not incredulous in belief. If it is fully internal, you should have a positive mindset.

当谈到治疗精神疾病的药物时，安慰剂效应是百分之百有效的。当涉及到你的思想时，你想要有积极的倾向，而不是怀疑信仰。如果它完全是内部的，你应该有一个积极的心态。

For example, I was reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, which is a fantastic introduction to being present, for people who are not religious. He shows you the single -most important thing is to be present and hammers it home over and over again until you get it.

例如，我正在读埃克哈特·托勒的“现在的力量”，这是一本关于在场的奇妙介绍，对于不信教的人来说是一本奇妙的入门书。他告诉你最重要的一件事就是在场，一遍又一遍地向你灌输，直到你得到它。

He wrote about this body -energy exercise. You lie down and you feel the energy moving around your body. At that point, the old me would have put the book down and said, “Well, that’s BS.” But the new me said, “Well, if I believe it, maybe it’ll work.” I went into it with a positive mindset. I laid down and tried the meditation. You know what? It felt really good.

他写了一篇关于这次身体能量运动的文章。你躺下，你感觉到能量在你的身体里移动。在这一点上，以前的我会把书放下，然后说，“嗯，那是胡说八道。”但是新的我说，“嗯，如果我相信的话，也许它能行得通。”我抱着积极的心态投入其中。我躺下来试了试冥想。你猜怎么着？感觉真的很好。

How does someone build the skill of happiness?
一个人如何构建快乐的技能呢？
You can build good habits. Not drinking alcohol will keep your mood more stable. Not eating sugar will keep your mood more stable. Not going on Facebook, Snapchat, or Twitter will keep your mood more stable. Playing video games will make you happier in the short run—and I used to be an avid gamer—but in the long run, it could ruin your happiness. You’re being fed dopamine and having dopamine withdrawn from you in these little uncontrollable ways. Caffeine is another one where you trade long term for the short term.

你可以养成好习惯。不喝酒会让你的情绪更稳定。不吃糖会让你的情绪更稳定。不上Facebook、Snapchat或Twitter会让你的情绪更稳定。玩电子游戏在短期内会让你更快乐-我曾经是一个狂热的游戏玩家-但从长远来看，它可能会毁了你的快乐。你被喂了多巴胺，然后以这些无法控制的方式从你体内抽出多巴胺。咖啡因是另一种长期交易短期交易的方法。

Essentially, you have to go through your life replacing your thoughtless bad habits with good ones, making a commitment to be a happier person. At the end of the day, you are a combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with.

从本质上说，你必须经历一生，用好习惯取代你粗心大意的坏习惯，承诺做一个更快乐的人。归根结底，你是你的习惯和你相处时间最多的人的结合体。

When we’re kids, we have very few habits. Over time, we learn the things we are not supposed to do. We become self -conscious . We start forming habits and routines.

当我们还是孩子的时候，我们几乎没有什么习惯。随着时间的推移，我们学会了我们不应该做的事情。我们会变得难为情。我们开始养成习惯和习惯。

Many distinctions between people who get happier as they get older and people who don’t can be explained by what habits they have developed. Are they habits that will increase your long -term happiness rather than your short -term happiness? Are you surrounding yourself with people who are generally positive and upbeat people? Are those relationships low -maintenance ? Do you admire and respect but not envy them?
随着年龄的增长而变得更快乐的人和不快乐的人之间的许多区别可以用他们养成的习惯来解释。这些习惯会增加你的长期幸福感而不是短期幸福感吗？你周围的人通常都是积极乐观的吗？这些关系都是低维护性的吗？你是否钦佩和尊重他们，而不是羡慕他们？
There’s the “five chimps theory” where you can predict a chimp’s behavior by the five chimps it hangs out with the most. I think that applies to humans as well. Maybe it’s politically incorrect to say you should choose your friends very wisely. But you shouldn’t choose them haphazardly based on who you live next to or who you happen to work with. The people who are the most happy and optimistic choose the right five chimps. [8]
有一个“五只黑猩猩理论”，你可以通过它最常出没的五只黑猩猩来预测它的行为。我认为这也适用于人类。也许说你应该非常明智地选择你的朋友在政治上是不正确的。但是你不应该根据你的邻居或者碰巧和你一起工作的人随意地选择他们。最快乐、最乐观的人选择正确的五只黑猩猩。

The first rule of handling conflict is: Don’t hang around people who constantly engage in conflict. I’m not interested in anything unsustainable or even hard to sustain, including difficult relationships. [5]
处理冲突的第一条规则是：不要和经常发生冲突的人混在一起。我对任何不可持续甚至难以维持的事情都不感兴趣，包括难以维系的关系。

If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.

如果你看不到自己与某人终生共事，那就不要与他们共事一天。

There’s a friend of mine, a Persian guy named Behzad. He just loves life, and he has no time for anybody who is not happy.

我有个朋友，一个叫贝扎德的波斯人。他就是热爱生活，没有时间陪任何不快乐的人。

If you ask Behzad what’s his secret? He’ll just look up and say, “Stop asking why and start saying wow.” The world is such an amazing place. As humans, we’re used to taking everything for granted. Like what you and I are doing right now. We’re sitting indoors, wearing clothes, well -fed , and communicating with each other through space and time. We should be two monkeys sitting in the jungle right now watching the sun going down, asking ourselves where we are going to sleep.

如果你问贝扎德他的秘诀是什么？他只会抬起头说，“别再问为什么了，开始说哇。”这个世界真是个令人惊叹的地方。作为人类，我们习惯于认为一切都是理所当然的。就像你和我现在正在做的一样。我们坐在室内，穿着衣服，吃得很饱，通过空间和时间相互交流。我们应该是现在坐在丛林里看着太阳下山的两只猴子，问自己我们要睡在哪里。

When we get something, we assume the world owes it to us. If you’re present, you’ll realize how many gifts and how much abundance there is around us at all times. That’s all you really need to do. I’m here now, and I have all these incredible things at my disposal. [8]
当我们得到一些东西时，我们会认为这是世界欠我们的。如果你在场，你就会意识到我们身边时刻都有多少礼物，有多少丰富的东西。这就是你真正需要做的一切。我现在就在这里，我有所有这些不可思议的东西可供我支配。

The most important trick to being happy is to realize happiness is a skill you develop and a choice you make. You choose to be happy, and then you work at it. It’s just like building muscles. It’s just like losing weight. It’s just like succeeding at your job. It’s just like learning calculus.

快乐最重要的诀窍是认识到快乐是你培养的一种技能，是你做出的选择。你选择快乐，然后努力去实现它。这就像锻炼肌肉一样。就像减肥一样。这就像在你的工作中取得成功一样。这就像学习微积分一样。

You decide it’s important to you. You prioritize it above everything else. You read everything on the topic. [7]
你决定这对你很重要。你把它放在首位。你阅读了关于这个主题的所有内容。

Happiness Habits
快乐习惯
I have a series of tricks I use to try and be happier in the moment. At first, they were silly and difficult and required a lot of attention, but now some of them have become second nature. By doing them religiously, I’ve managed to increase my happiness level quite a bit.

我有一系列的诀窍，我用来试着让自己在这一刻更快乐。起初，它们又傻又难，需要很多关注，但现在它们中的一些已经变成了第二天性。通过虔诚地做这些事情，我设法提高了我的幸福感水平。

The obvious one is meditation—insight meditation. Working toward a specific purpose on it, which is to try and understand how my mind works. [7]
最明显的一种是冥想--洞察力冥想。朝着一个特定的目标努力，那就是试着理解我的大脑是如何运作的。

Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?” I used to get annoyed about things. Now I always look for the positive side of it. It used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Now I can do it sub -second . [7]
只是每时每刻都非常清醒。如果我发现自己在评判某人，我会停下来说，“这是什么积极的解读呢？”我过去常常对事情感到恼火。现在我总是在寻找它积极的一面。过去，这需要理性的努力。过去我需要几秒钟的时间才能得出一个肯定的结论。现在我可以做到亚秒级。“[7]
I try to get more sunlight on my skin. I look up and smile. [7]
我试着让更多的阳光照射到我的皮肤上。我抬头微笑。

Every time you catch yourself desiring something, say, “Is it so important to me I’ll be unhappy unless this goes my way?” You’re going to find with the vast majority of things it’s just not true. [7]
每次当你发现自己渴望某样东西时，就说，“这对我来说如此重要吗？除非我按自己的方式去做，否则我就不会快乐。”你会发现绝大多数事情都不是真的。

I think dropping caffeine made me happier. It makes me more of a stable person. [7]
我想滴咖啡因会让我更开心。这让我成为一个更稳重的人。

I think working out every day made me happier. If you have peace of body, it’s easier to have peace of mind. [7]
我认为每天锻炼让我更快乐。如果你身体平静，你的心灵就更容易平静。“[7]
The more you judge, the more you separate yourself. You’ll feel good for an instant, because you feel good about yourself, thinking you’re better than someone. Later, you’re going to feel lonely. Then, you see negativity everywhere. The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. [77]
你评判得越多，你就越会把自己分开。你会瞬间感觉良好，因为你自我感觉良好，认为自己比别人强。稍后，你会感到孤独。然后，你会看到到处都是负面的东西。这个世界只是把你自己的感觉反映在你身上。

Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it. You’ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person. [5]
告诉你的朋友你是个快乐的人。然后，你将被迫遵守它。你会有一种一致性偏见。你必须做到这一点。你的朋友会期望你是一个快乐的人。

Recover time and happiness by minimizing your use of these three smartphone apps: phone, calendar, and alarm clock. [11]
通过最大限度地减少使用手机、日历和闹钟这三个智能手机应用程序来恢复时间和幸福感。

The more secrets you have, the less happy you’re going to be. [11]
你拥有的秘密越多，你就越不快乐。

Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day. [11]
被吓到了吗？用冥想、音乐和锻炼来重置你的情绪。然后选择一条新的道路，在一天的剩余时间里投入情感能量。

Hedonic adaptation is more powerful for man -made things (cars, houses, clothes, money) than for natural things (food, sex, exercise). [11]
享乐适应对于人造的东西(汽车、房子、衣服、金钱)比对自然的东西(食物、性、锻炼)更有效。

No exceptions—all screen activities linked to less happiness, all non -screen activities linked to more happiness. [11]
没有例外-所有的屏幕活动都与更少的幸福联系在一起，所有的非屏幕活动都与更多的幸福联系在一起。

A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest? [11]
一个个人指标：一天中有多少时间是出于义务而不是出于兴趣去做事情的？
It’s the news’ job to make you anxious and angry. But its underlying scientific, economic, education, and conflict trends are positive. Stay optimistic. [11]
新闻的工作就是让你焦虑和愤怒。但其潜在的科学、经济、教育和冲突趋势是积极的。保持乐观。“[11]
Politics, academia, and social status are all zero -sum games. Positive -sum games create positive people. [11]
政治、学术和社会地位都是零和游戏。正和游戏造就了积极向上的人。

Increase serotonin in the brain without drugs: Sunlight, exercise, positive thinking, and tryptophan. [11]
在没有药物的情况下增加大脑中的5-羟色胺：阳光、锻炼、积极思考和色氨酸。

Changing habits:
改变习惯：
Pick one thing. Cultivate a desire. Visualize it.

挑一样东西。培养一种欲望。想象一下。

Plan a sustainable path.

规划一条可持续的道路。

Identify needs, triggers, and substitutes.

确定需求、触发因素和替代品。

Tell your friends.

告诉你的朋友。

Track meticulously.

一丝不苟地追踪。

Self -discipline is a bridge to a new self -image .

自律是通向新的自我形象的桥梁。

Bake in the new self -image . It’s who you are—now. [11]
烘焙新的自我形象。这就是你-现在。[11]
First, you know it. Then, you understand it. Then, you can explain it. Then, you can feel it. Finally, you are it.

首先，你是知道的。那么，你就明白了。那你就可以解释了。然后，你就能感觉到了。终于，你就是它了。

 Find Happiness in Acceptance
在接受中寻找快乐
In any situation in life, you always have three choices: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it.

在生活中的任何情况下，你总是有三个选择：你可以改变它，你可以接受它，或者你可以离开它。

If you want to change it, then it is a desire. It will cause you suffering until you successfully change it. So don’t pick too many of those. Pick one big desire in your life at any given time to give yourself purpose and motivation.

如果你想改变它，那它就是一种愿望。除非你成功地改变它，否则它会给你带来痛苦。所以不要摘太多这样的东西。在任何给定的时间，在你的生活中选择一个最大的愿望，给自己目标和动力。

Why not two?
为什么不是两个呢？
You’ll be distracted.

你会分心的。

Even one is hard enough. Being peaceful comes from having your mind clear of thoughts. And a lot of clarity comes from being in the present moment. It’s very hard to be in the present moment if you’re thinking, “I need to do this. I want that. This has got to change.” [8]
即使只有一个也够难的了。平和来自于头脑中清晰的思想。而很多清晰的东西都来自于当下。如果你在想，“我需要做这件事，那你就很难活在当下。我要那个。这种情况必须改变。“[8]
You always have three options: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you could leave it but not leaving it and not accepting it. That struggle or aversion is responsible for most of our misery. The phrase I probably use the most to myself in my head is just one word: “accept.” [5]
你总是有三个选择：你可以改变它，你可以接受它，或者你可以离开它。不是一个好的选择，那就是坐在那里希望你能改变它但不改变它，希望你能离开它但不能离开它而不接受它。这种斗争或厌恶是我们大部分痛苦的罪魁祸首。我脑海中对自己用得最多的一句话可能只有一个词：“接受”。

What does acceptance look like to you?
在你看来，接受是什么样子的？
It’s to be okay whatever the outcome is. It’s to be balanced and centered. It’s to step back and to see the grander scheme of things.

不管结果如何，一切都会好起来的。它要保持平衡，居中。它是退后一步，看看更宏伟的计划。

We don’t always get what we want, but sometimes what is happening is for the best. The sooner you can accept it as a reality, the sooner you can adapt to it.

我们并不总是得到我们想要的，但有时正在发生的事情是最好的。你越早接受它成为现实，你就越早适应它。

Achieving acceptance is very difficult. I have a couple of hacks I try, but I wouldn’t say they are totally successful.

要获得认可是非常困难的。我试过几种破解方法，但我不会说它们完全成功。

One hack is stepping back and looking at previous bits of suffering I’ve had in my life. I write them down. “Last time you broke up with somebody, last time you had a business failure, last time you had a health issue, what happened?” I can trace the growth and improvement that came from it years later.

其中一个技巧是退后一步，回顾我生活中以前经历过的一些痛苦。我把它们写下来。“上一次你和某人分手，上一次你生意失败，上一次你身体有问题，发生了什么事？”我可以追溯到几年后它带来的成长和进步。

I have another hack I use for minor annoyances. When they happen, a part of me will instantly react negatively. But I’ve learned to mentally ask myself, “What is the positive of this situation?”
我还有另一个用来做小麻烦的黑客。当它们发生时，我身体的一部分会立即做出负面反应。但我学会了在心里问问自己，“这种情况的积极面是什么？”
“Okay, I’ll be late for a meeting. But what is the benefit to me? I get to relax and watch the birds for a moment. I’ll also spend less time in that boring meeting.” There’s almost always something positive.

“好的，我开会要迟到了。但是这对我有什么好处呢？我可以放松一下，看一会儿鸟儿。我也会在那个无聊的会议上少花点时间。“几乎总会有积极的事情发生。

Even if you can’t come up with something positive, you can say, “Well, the Universe is going to teach me something now. Now I get to listen and learn.”
即使你拿不出积极的东西，你也可以说，“好吧，宇宙现在要教我一些东西。现在我可以边听边学。“
To give you the simplest example: I was at an event and afterward, someone flooded my inbox with a whole bunch of photos they took.

举个最简单的例子：我参加了一个活动，事后，有人把他们拍的一大堆照片塞进了我的收件箱。

There was a tiny instant judgment saying, “Come on, couldn’t you have just selected a few of the best? Who sends a hundred photos?” But then immediately I asked myself, “What is the positive?” The positive is that I get to pick my five favorite photos. I get to use my judgment.

有一个小小的瞬间判断说，“来吧，你就不能选几个最好的吗？谁会发一百张照片呢？“但我马上问自己，“积极的一面是什么？”积极的一面是，我可以挑选我最喜欢的五张照片。我可以用我的判断力。

Over the last year, by practicing this hack enough, I’ve managed to go from taking a couple of seconds to think of a response, to now my brain doing it almost instantaneously. That’s a habit you can train yourself to do. [8]
在过去的一年里，通过足够多地练习这个技巧，我已经成功地从花几秒钟想出一个回应，到现在我的大脑几乎是瞬间做出反应的。这是一个你可以训练自己去做的习惯。

How do you learn to accept things you can’t change?
你如何学会接受你不能改变的事情？
Fundamentally, it boils down to one big hack: embracing death.

从根本上说，它可以归结为一个大技巧：拥抱死亡。

Death is the most important thing that is ever going to happen to you. When you look at your death and you acknowledge it, rather than running away from it, it’ll bring great meaning to your life. We spend so much of our life trying to avoid death. So much of what we struggle for can be classified as a quest for immortality.

死亡是将要发生在你身上的最重要的事情。当你正视自己的死亡并承认它，而不是逃避它时，它会给你的生活带来巨大的意义。我们一生中的很多时间都在努力避免死亡。我们为之奋斗的许多东西都可以归类为对不朽的追求。

If you’re religious and believe there is an afterlife, then you’ll be taken care of. If you’re not religious, maybe you’ll have kids. If you’re an artist, a painter, or a businessman, you want to leave a legacy behind.

如果你有宗教信仰，相信有来世，那么你就会得到照顾。如果你不信教，也许你会有孩子。如果你是一名艺术家、画家或商人，你想留下一份遗产。

Here’s a hot tip: There is no legacy. There’s nothing to leave. We’re all going to be gone. Our children will be gone. Our works will be dust. Our civilizations will be dust. Our planet will be dust. Our solar system will be dust. In the grand scheme of things, the Universe has been around for ten billion years. It’ll be around for another ten billion years.

这里有一个热门提示：没有任何遗产。没有什么可以留下的。我们都要走了。我们的孩子将会离开。我们的作品将化为灰烬。我们的文明将化为灰烬。我们的星球将会变成尘埃。我们的太阳系将会变成尘埃。在宏伟的计划中，宇宙已经存在了100亿年。它还将存在100亿年。

Your life is a firefly blink in a night. You’re here for such a brief period of time. If you fully acknowledge the futility of what you’re doing, then I think it can bring great happiness and peace because you realize this is a game. But it’s a fun game. All that matters is you experience your reality as you go through life. Why not interpret it in the most positive possible way?
你的生活就像一夜之间的萤火虫在眨眼。你在这里只待了这么短的一段时间。如果你充分认识到你正在做的事情是徒劳的，那么我认为它可以带来巨大的快乐和平静，因为你意识到这是一场游戏。但这是个有趣的游戏。重要的是你在生活中体验你的现实。为什么不用最积极的方式来解释呢？
Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. It’s not like your unhappiness makes them better off somehow. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. Keeping death on the forefront and not denying it is very important.

任何你不开心的时刻，当你不是真正快乐的时候，你都不是在帮任何人的忙。这并不是说你的不快乐会让他们过得更好。你所做的一切都是在浪费你在这个地球上拥有的这令人难以置信的小而宝贵的时间。把死亡放在最前面，而不是否认它是非常重要的。

Whenever I get caught up in my ego battles, I just think of entire civilizations that have come and gone. For example, take the Sumerians. I’m sure they were important people and did great things, but go ahead and name me a single Sumerian. Tell me anything interesting or important Sumerians did that lasted. Nothing.

每当我陷入自我斗争时，我只会想到来来去去的整个文明。例如，以苏美尔人为例。我确信他们是重要人物，做了伟大的事情，但请继续，给我一个苏美尔人的名字。告诉我苏美尔人做了什么有趣的或重要的事。没什么。

So maybe ten thousand years from now or a hundred thousand years from now, people will say, “Oh yeah, Americans. I’ve heard of Americans.” [8]
所以也许一万年后或者十万年后，人们会说，“哦，是的，美国人。我听说过美国人。“[8]
You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work. [8]
你总有一天会死的，这一切都无关紧要了。所以好好享受吧。做一些积极的事情。投射一些爱。让某人开心。笑一笑。感谢这一刻。做好你的工作。“[8]

Doctors won’t make you healthy.

Nutritionists won’t make you slim.

Teachers won’t make you smart.

Gurus won’t make you calm.

Mentors won’t make you rich.

Trainers won’t make you fit.

医生不会让你健康，
营养师不会让你苗条，
老师不会让你聪明，
上师不会让你平静，
导师不会让你致富，
训练员不会让你健康。

Ultimately, you have to take responsibility.

归根结底，你必须承担责任。

Save yourself.
