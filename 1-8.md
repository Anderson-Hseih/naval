# Get Paid for Your Judgment

因为你的判断而得到报酬
Choosing what kinds of jobs, careers, or fields you get into and what sort of deals you’re willing to take from your employer will give you much more free time. Then, you don’t have to worry as much about time management. I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment. [1]
选择你所从事的工作、职业或领域，以及你愿意从雇主那里得到什么样的交易，都会给你更多的自由时间。那么，你就不必那么担心时间管理了。我希望纯粹因为我的判断而得到报酬，而不是因为任何工作。我想要一个机器人、资本或计算机来做这项工作，但我想要我的判断得到报酬。

I think every human should aspire to being knowledgeable about certain things and being paid for our unique knowledge. We have as much leverage as is possible in our business, whether it’s through robots or computers or what have you. Then, we can be masters of our own time because we are just being tracked on outputs and not inputs.
我认为每个人都应该渴望对某些事情有所了解，并因我们独特的知识而获得报酬。我们在我们的业务中拥有尽可能多的筹码，无论是通过机器人还是计算机，或者你拥有的任何东西。然后，我们可以成为我们自己时代的主人，因为我们只是被跟踪输出，而不是输入。

Imagine someone comes along who demonstrably has slightly better judgment. They’re right 85 percent of the time instead of 75 percent. You will pay them $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, whatever it takes, because 10 percent better judgment steering a $100 billion ship is very valuable. CEOs are highly paid because of their leverage. Small differences in judgment and capability really get amplified. [2]
想象一下，有个人出现了，他的判断力明显稍好一些。他们在85%的时间里是正确的，而不是75%。你会付给他们5000万美元，1亿美元，2亿美元，不惜一切代价，因为驾驶一艘1000亿美元的船的判断力提高了10%，这是非常有价值的。首席执行官们的高薪是因为他们的杠杆作用。判断力和能力上的微小差异真的会被放大。

Demonstrated judgment—credibility around the judgment—is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He’s been highly accountable. He’s been right over and over in the public domain. He’s built a reputation for very high integrity, so you can trust him. People will throw infinite leverage behind him because of his judgment. Nobody asks him how hard he works. Nobody asks him when he wakes up or when he goes to sleep. They’re like, “Warren, just do your thing.”
被证明的判断力-围绕判断力的可信度-是如此关键。沃伦·巴菲特(Warren Buffett)在这里获胜，因为他拥有巨大的可信度。他一直高度负责。他一次又一次地出现在公共领域。他建立了非常正直的声誉，所以你可以信任他。人们会因为他的判断力而在他身后投出无限的筹码。没人问他工作有多努力。没有人问他什么时候醒来，什么时候睡觉。他们就像是，“沃伦，做你该做的。”
Judgment—especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability and a clear track record—is critical. [78]
判断力-特别是表现出来的判断力，具有高度的问责制和明确的记录-是至关重要的。“[78]
We waste our time with short -term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades.
我们把时间浪费在短视的思考和忙碌的工作上。沃伦·巴菲特(Warren Buffett)花了一年时间做决定，花一天时间表演。这一行为持续了几十年。

Just from being marginally better, like running a quarter mile a fraction of a second faster, some people get paid a lot more—orders of magnitude more. Leverage magnifies those differences even more. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage. [2]
仅仅是稍微好一点，比如跑四分之一英里快了零点几秒，有些人的报酬就高得多--多了几个数量级。杠杆作用进一步放大了这些差异。在这个杠杆化的时代，在你的艺术中达到极致是非常重要的。


 Prioritize and Focus
确定优先顺序和重点
I’ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune I made I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune I made, or should have made, I basically got cheated out of by my business partners. It’s only the third time around that has been a charm.
我一路上遇到了很多厄运。我赚到的第一笔小财富马上就输在了股票市场上。我赚的或者应该赚的第二小笔钱，基本上被我的商业伙伴骗走了。这已经是第三次了，这是一种魅力。

Even then, it has been a slow and steady struggle. I haven’t made money in my life in one giant payout. It has always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, creating opportunities, and creating investments. It hasn’t been a giant one -off thing. My personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It just stacks up a little bit, a few chips at a time: more options, more businesses, more investments, more things I can do.
即便如此，这也是一场缓慢而稳定的斗争。我这辈子还没有在一次巨额支出中赚过钱。它总是一大堆小东西堆积在一起。它更多的是通过创造商业、创造机会和创造投资来持续创造财富。这并不是一件巨大的一次性的事情。我的个人财富不是靠一个大年份创造出来的。它只是堆积了一点，一次几个芯片：更多的选择，更多的业务，更多的投资，更多的事情我可以做。

Thanks to the internet, opportunities are massively abundant. In fact, I have too many ways to make money. I don’t have enough time. I literally have opportunities pouring out of my ears, and I keep running out of time. There are so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, and to get paid by society as a byproduct. I just can’t handle them all. [78]
多亏了互联网，机会非常丰富。事实上，我有太多赚钱的方法。我没有足够的时间。我真的有大量的机会从我的耳朵里涌出，而我一直在耗尽时间。有很多方法可以创造财富，创造产品，创造企业，并作为副产品获得社会的报酬。我就是处理不了所有的问题。

Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you’re worth.
以小时计价珍惜你的时间，并毫不留情地花在这个速度上来节省时间。你的价值永远不会超过你认为自己的价值。

No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even when I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth, and I started treating myself that way.
没有人会比你更看重你自己。你只需要设定一个非常高的个人时薪，而且你必须坚持下去。甚至在我年轻的时候，我就认为我的价值比市场认为的要高得多，我开始这样对待自己。

Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? It’s going to take you an hour to get across town to get something. If you value yourself at one hundred dollars an hour, that’s basically throwing one hundred dollars out of your pocket. Are you going to do that? [78]
每一个决定都要考虑到你的时间因素。需要多长时间？你要花一个小时穿过镇子去买点东西。如果你对自己的估值是每小时100美元，那基本上就是从你的口袋里掏出100美元。你要做那件事吗？[78]
Fast -forward to your wealthy self and pick some intermediate hourly rate. For me, believe it or not, back when you could have hired me…Which now obviously you can’t, but back when you could have hired me…this was true a decade ago or even two decades ago, before I had any real money. My hourly rate, I used to say to myself over and over, is $5,000 an hour. Today when I look back, really it was about $1,000 an hour.
快进到你富有的自己，选择一些中间的时薪。对我来说，信不信由你，回到你可以雇我的时候，…现在很明显你不能，但是回到你可以雇我的时候，…十年前，甚至二十年前，在我还没有真正的钱之前，这是真的。我过去一遍又一遍地对自己说，我的时薪是每小时5000美元。今天当我回头看的时候，真的是每小时1000美元左右。

Of course, I still ended up doing stupid things like arguing with the electrician or returning the broken speaker, but I shouldn’t have, and I did a lot less than any of my friends would. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash pile or giving it to Salvation Army rather than trying to return it or handing something to people rather than trying to fix it.
当然，我最终还是做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如和电工吵架，或者把坏掉的扬声器退回，但我不应该这样做，而且我做的事情比我的任何朋友都要少得多。我会把一些东西扔进垃圾堆，或者把它送给救世军，而不是试图把它归还，或者把东西递给人们，而不是试图修复它，这是一场戏剧表演。

I would argue with my girlfriends, and even today it’s my wife, “I don’t do that. That’s not a problem that I solve.” I still argue that with my mother when she hands me little to -do ’s. I just don’t do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn’t have money. [78]
我会和我的女朋友争执，即使在今天也是我的妻子，“我不会那样做。这不是我能解决的问题。“当我母亲给我一些待办事项时，我仍然会和她争论这一点。我只是不会那么做。我宁愿给你雇个助理。即使在我没有钱的时候，这也是真的。“[78]
Another way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead. [78]
思考某事的另一种方式是，如果你能以低于时薪的价格外包某事或不做某事，那就外包或不做。如果你可以雇佣比你的时薪更低的人来做这件事，那就雇佣他们吧。这甚至包括像做饭这样的事情。你可能想吃健康的家常菜，但如果你能外包，那就这么做吧。

Set a very high hourly aspirational rate for yourself and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn’t, it’s not high enough. Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, it’s multiple millions of dollars per year.
为自己设定一个非常高的每小时渴望速率，并坚持下去。它应该看起来和感觉上高得离谱。如果不是，那就是不够高。不管你选什么，我给你的建议是提高它。就像我说的，对我自己来说，甚至在我还没有钱之前，我就用了每小时5000美元，这是最长的一次。如果你把它外推到看起来像是年薪的地方，那就是每年几百万美元。

Ironically, I actually think I’ve beaten it. I’m not the hardest working person—I’m actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where I’m really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much I’ve earned per actual hour that I’ve put in, it’s probably quite a bit higher than that. [78]
具有讽刺意味的是，我真的认为我打败了它。我不是最勤奋的人--我实际上是个懒人。我在精力迸发的情况下工作，在那里我真的是有动力的。如果我真的看看我每实际投入一小时赚了多少钱，可能会比这个数字高出很多。“[78]
Can you expand on your statement, “If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you”?
你能再详述一下你的说法吗？“如果你暗地里鄙视财富，它就会躲避你”。

If you get into a relative mindset, you’re always going to hate people who do better than you, you’re always going to be jealous or envious of them. They’ll sense those feelings when you try and do business with them. When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset. [10]
如果你进入一种相对的心态，你总是会憎恨比你做得更好的人，你总是会嫉妒或羡慕他们。当你试着和他们做生意时，他们会感觉到这种感觉。当你试图与某人做生意时，如果你对他们有任何不好的想法或判断，他们会感觉到的。人类与生俱来就能感受到他人内心深处的感受。你必须走出相对的思维定势。

Literally, being anti -wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right mindset for it, you won’t have the right spirit, and you won’t be dealing with people on the right level. Be optimistic, be positive. It’s important. Optimists actually do better in the long run. [10]
从字面上看，反财富会阻止你变得富有，因为你不会有正确的心态，你不会有正确的精神，你也不会在正确的层面上与人打交道。要乐观，要积极。这很重要。从长远来看，乐观主义者实际上做得更好。

The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.
商界有很多人玩零和游戏，少数人玩正和游戏，在人群中互相寻找。

There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it’s going to solve all of your money problems. People realize that, so they want to make money.
从根本上说，人们生活中有两个巨大的游戏可玩。一个是金钱游戏。因为钱不会解决你所有的问题，但它会解决你所有的钱问题。人们意识到了这一点，所以他们想赚钱。

But at the same time, many of them, deep down, believe they can’t make money. They don’t want any wealth creation to happen. So, they attack the whole enterprise by saying, “Well, making money is evil. You shouldn’t do it.”
但与此同时，他们中的许多人在内心深处认为自己赚不到钱。他们不希望任何财富创造发生。因此，他们攻击整个企业说，“嗯，赚钱是邪恶的。你不应该这么做。“
But they’re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They’re trying to be high status in the eyes of other people watching by saying, “Well, I don’t need money. We don’t want money.” Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy. [78]
但他们实际上在玩另一个游戏，那就是状态游戏。他们试图通过说“嗯，我不需要钱”来在其他人的眼里保持较高的地位。我们不要钱。“地位是你在社会等级中的排名。

Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive -sum game. Status is an old zero -sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.
财富创造是一种进化上最近的正和游戏。地位是一个古老的零和游戏。那些攻击财富创造的人往往只是为了寻求地位。

Status is a zero -sum game. It’s a very old game. We’ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It’s hierarchical. Who’s number one? Who’s number two? Who’s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero -sum game.
地位是一个零和游戏。这是一个非常古老的游戏。我们从猴子部落就开始玩了。这是分等级的。谁是第一名？谁是第二名？谁是三号？为了让三号移动到二号，二号必须移出那个位置。所以，地位是一个零和游戏。

Politics is an example of a status game. Even sports are an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. I don’t fundamentally love status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who’s in charge. But fundamentally, you play them because they’re a necessary evil. [78]
政治是地位游戏的一个例子。即使是体育运动也是地位游戏的一个例子。要想成为赢家，就必须有失败者。我根本不喜欢状态游戏。他们在我们的社会中扮演着重要的角色，所以我们可以弄清楚谁是负责人。但从根本上说，你玩弄它们是因为它们是一种必要的邪恶。

The problem is, to win at a status game, you have to put somebody else down. That’s why you should avoid status games in your life—they make you into an angry, combative person. You’re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people you like up.
问题是，要想在状态游戏中取胜，你必须击倒别人。这就是为什么你应该避免在你的生活中玩状态游戏--它们会让你变成一个愤怒、好斗的人。你总是努力贬低别人，贬低你自己和你喜欢的人。

Status games are always going to exist. There’s no way around it, but realize most of the time, when you’re trying to create wealth and you’re getting attacked by someone else, they’re trying to increase their own status at your expense. They’re playing a different game. And it’s a worse game. It’s a zero -sum game instead of a positive -sum game. [78]
地位游戏总是会存在的。这是别无选择的，但你要意识到，大多数时候，当你试图创造财富，而你却受到别人的攻击时，他们是在试图以牺牲你为代价来提高自己的地位。他们在玩不同的游戏。这是一场更糟糕的比赛。这是一个零和游戏，而不是正和游戏。

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
玩愚蠢的游戏，赢得愚蠢的奖品。

What is the most important thing to do for younger people starting out?
对于开始创业的年轻人来说，最重要的事情是什么？
Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.
花更多的时间做重大决定。在你的早期生活中，基本上有三个真正重大的决定：你住在哪里，你和谁在一起，以及你做什么。

We spend very little time deciding which relationship to get into. We spend so much time in a job, but we spend so little time deciding which job to get into. Choosing what city to live in can almost completely determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time trying to figure out what city to live in.
我们花很少的时间来决定要建立哪种关系。我们在一份工作上花费了如此多的时间，但我们花在决定从事哪一份工作上的时间却如此之少。选择住在哪个城市几乎可以完全决定你的生活轨迹，但我们花在试图弄清楚住在哪个城市上的时间太少了。

Advice to a young engineer considering moving to San Francisco: “Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?”
给一位考虑搬到旧金山的年轻工程师的建议：“你想把你的朋友留在后面吗？还是那个落在后面的人？“
If you’re going to live in a city for ten years, if you’re going to be in a job for five years, if you’re in a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.
如果你要在一个城市生活十年，如果你要工作五年，如果你要谈一段十年的恋爱，你应该花一到两年的时间来决定这些事情。这些都是具有高度支配性的决定。这三个决定真的很重要。

You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems. Those three are probably the three biggest ones. [1]
你必须对一切说不，腾出时间来解决重要的问题。这三个可能是最大的三个。

What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people?
要让自己周围都是成功人士，你会采取什么一两个步骤呢？
Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count. [7]
找出你擅长什么，然后开始帮助别人。送人吧。把它发扬光大。因果报应之所以有效，是因为人们是始终如一的。在足够长的时间尺度上，你会吸引你所投射的东西。但是不要测量--如果你数一数，你的耐心就会耗尽。

An old boss once warned: “You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough.”
一位老老板曾警告说：“你永远不会变得富有，因为你显然很聪明，而且总会有人给你提供一份刚刚好的工作。”
How did you decide to start your first company?
你是如何决定创办你的第一家公司的？
I was working at this tech company called @Home Network, and I told everybody around me—my boss, coworkers, my friends, “In Silicon Valley, all of these other people are starting companies. It looks like they can do it. I’m going to start a company. I’m just here temporarily. I’m an entrepreneur.”
我在一家名为@Home Network的科技公司工作，我告诉我周围的每个人--我的老板、同事、朋友，“在硅谷，所有这些人都在创业。看起来他们能做到。我要开一家公司。我只是暂时来这里。我是一名企业家。“
…I didn’t actually mean to trick myself into it. It wasn’t a deliberate, calculated thing.
…我并不是真的想骗自己去做这件事。这不是一件经过深思熟虑、经过深思熟虑的事情。

I was just venting, talking out loud, being overly honest. But I didn’t actually start a company. This was in 1996, it was a much scarier, more difficult proposition to start a company then. Sure enough, everyone started saying “What are you still doing here? I thought you were leaving to start a company?” and “Wow, you’re still here…” I was literally embarrassed into starting my own company. [5]
我只是在发泄，大声说话，太诚实了。但实际上我并没有开公司。那是在1996年，当时创办一家公司是一个可怕得多、困难得多的提议。果然，每个人都开始说“你还在这里做什么？我还以为你要离开去开公司呢？“还有“哇，你还在这里，…”我真的很尴尬，开了自己的公司。

Yes, I know some people aren’t necessarily ready to be entrepreneurs, but long -term , where did we come up with this idea the correct logical thing to do is for everybody to work for somebody else? It is a very hierarchical model. [14]
是的，我知道有些人不一定准备好成为企业家，但从长远来看，我们是从哪里想出这个想法的正确的合乎逻辑的事情是每个人都为别人工作？这是一个等级很高的模型。“[14]
 Find Work That Feels Like Play
找一份感觉像是娱乐的工作
Humans evolved as hunters and gatherers where we all worked for ourselves. It’s only at the beginning of agriculture we became more hierarchical. The Industrial Revolution and factories made us extremely hierarchical because one individual couldn’t necessarily own or build a factory, but now, thanks to the internet, we’re going back to an age where more and more people can work for themselves. I would rather be a failed entrepreneur than someone who never tried. Because even a failed entrepreneur has the skill set to make it on their own. [14]
人类进化为狩猎者和采集者，在那里我们都为自己工作。只是在农业刚开始的时候，我们才变得更加等级森严。工业革命和工厂让我们变得非常等级化，因为一个人不一定能拥有或建造工厂，但现在，多亏了互联网，我们正在回到一个越来越多的人可以为自己工作的时代。我宁愿做一个失败的企业家，也不愿做一个从未尝试过的人。因为即使是一个失败的企业家也有靠自己成功的技能。

There are almost 7 billion people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7 billion companies.
这个星球上几乎有70亿人。我希望，有一天，会有近70亿家公司。

I learned how to make money because it was a necessity. After it stopped being a necessity, I stopped caring about it. At least for me, work was a means to an end. Making money was a means to an end. I’m much more interested in solving problems than I am in making money.
我学会了如何赚钱，因为这是必需品。在它不再是必需品之后，我就不再关心它了。至少对我来说，工作是达到目的的一种手段。赚钱是达到目的的一种手段。比起赚钱，我对解决问题更感兴趣。

Any end goal will just lead to another goal, lead to another goal. We just play games in life. When you grow up, you’re playing the school game, or you’re playing the social game. Then you’re playing the money game, and then you’re playing the status game. These games just have longer and longer and longer -lived horizons. At some point, at least I believe, these are all just games. These are games where the outcome really stops mattering once you see through the game.
任何最终目标都只会通向另一个目标，通向另一个目标。我们只是在生活中玩游戏。当你长大后，你是在玩学校游戏，还是在玩社交游戏。然后你在玩金钱游戏，然后你在玩地位游戏。这些游戏的视野越来越长，寿命越来越长。在某种程度上，至少我相信，这些都只是一场游戏。在这些游戏中，一旦你看透了游戏，结果就不再重要了。

Then you just get tired of games. I would say I’m at the stage where I’m just tired of games. I don’t think there is any end goal or purpose. I’m just living life as I want to. I’m literally just doing it moment to moment.
那你就是厌倦了游戏。我会说我正处在一个我只是厌倦了游戏的阶段。我不认为有任何最终目标或目的。我只是过着我想要的生活。我真的是时时刻刻都在这么做。

I want to be off the hedonic treadmill. [1]
我想离开享乐主义跑步机。

What you really want is freedom. You want freedom from your money problems, right? I think that’s okay. Once you can solve your money problems, either by lowering your lifestyle or by making enough money, you want to retire. Not retirement at sixty -five years old, sitting in a nursing home collecting a check retirement—it’s a different definition.
你真正想要的是自由。你想从金钱问题中解脱出来，对吧？我想那没问题。一旦你可以通过降低生活方式或赚足够的钱来解决你的金钱问题，你就想退休了。不是在65岁退休，坐在疗养院领取退休支票-这是一个不同的定义。

What is your definition of retirement?
你对退休的定义是什么？
Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.
退休就是你不再为了想象中的明天而牺牲今天。今天结束后，你就可以退休了。

How do you get there?
你怎么去那里？
Well, one way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate.
嗯，一种方法是存很多钱，这样你的被动收入(不需要你动一根手指)就可以覆盖你的烧伤率。

A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero—you become a monk.
第二，你只要把你的烧伤率降到零--你就成了一名僧侣。

A third is you’re doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it’s not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.
第三个是你正在做你喜欢做的事情。你太享受了，这不是钱的问题。所以退休的方式有很多种。

The way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic, to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody. You know how to do it better because you love it, and no one can compete with you. If you love to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some leverage and put your name on it. You take the risks, but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you’re doing, and just crank it up. [77]
走出竞争陷阱的方法是做真实的事情，找到你知道如何做得比任何人都好的事情。你知道如何做得更好，因为你热爱它，没有人能与你竞争。如果你喜欢这样做，那就做一个真实的人，然后弄清楚如何将它映射到社会真正想要的东西上。施加一些筹码，把你的名字写在上面。你承担风险，但你获得了回报，对你所做的事情拥有所有权和权益，然后就把它发动起来。

Did your motivation to earn money drop after you become financially independent?
当你经济独立后，你赚钱的动力有没有下降？
Yes and no. It did in the sense the desperation was gone.
是也不是。从某种意义上说，它确实做到了，绝望已经消失了。

But if anything, creating businesses and making money are now more of an “art.” [74]
但如果说有什么不同的话，那就是创业和赚钱现在更像是一门“艺术”。

Whether in commerce, science, or politics—history remembers the artists.
无论是在商业、科学还是政治领域，历史都会记住艺术家。

Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there’s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing. To me, creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it’s fun, because I’m into the product. [77]
艺术就是创造力。艺术是任何为了它自己而做的事情。有哪些事情是为了自己的利益而做的，而它们背后却什么都没有呢？爱一个人，创造一些东西，玩耍。对我来说，创业就是玩耍。我做生意是因为它有趣，因为我喜欢这个产品。

I can create a new business within three months: raise the money, assemble a team, and launch it. It’s fun for me. It’s really cool to see what can I put together. It makes money almost as a side effect. Creating businesses is the game I became good at. It’s just my motivation has shifted from being goal -oriented to being artistic. Ironically, I think I’m much better at it now. [74]
我可以在三个月内创建一家新公司：筹集资金，组建一个团队，然后启动它。这对我来说很有趣。看看我能拼凑出什么真的很酷。它赚钱几乎是一种副作用。创业是我擅长的游戏。只是我的动机已经从目标导向转向艺术。具有讽刺意味的是，我认为我现在做得要好得多。

Even when I invest, it’s because I like the people involved, I like hanging out with them, I learn from them, I think the product is really cool. These days, I will pass on great investments because I don’t find the products interesting.
即使当我投资的时候，也是因为我喜欢参与其中的人，我喜欢和他们在一起，我从他们身上学到了东西，我认为这个产品真的很酷。这几天，我会放弃很棒的投资，因为我觉得这些产品没什么意思。

These are not 100 percent -or -nothing things. You can start moving more and more toward that goal in your life. It’s a goal. When I was younger, I used to be so desperate to make money that I would have done anything. If you’d shown up and said, “Hey, I’ve got a sewage trucking business, want to go into that?” I would have said, “Great, I want to make money!” Thank God no one gave me that opportunity. I’m glad I went down the road of technology and science, which I genuinely enjoy. I got to combine my vocation and my avocation.
这些都不是百分之百或一无所有的事情。在你的生活中，你可以开始越来越多地朝着那个目标前进。这是个进球。当我年轻的时候，我常常不顾一切地赚钱，以至于我什么都愿意做。如果你出现并说，“嘿，我有一家污水卡车运输公司，你想进去吗？”我会说，“太好了，我想赚钱！”谢天谢地没人给我这个机会。我很高兴我走上了科技之路，这是我真心享受的。我必须把我的职业和业余爱好结合起来。

I’m always “working.” It looks like work to others, but it feels like play to me. And that’s how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing, for sixteen hours a day. If others want to compete with me, they’re going to work, and they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. [77]
我总是在“工作”。对别人来说，这看起来像是工作，但对我来说，它感觉像是玩耍。这就是为什么我知道没有人能在这方面与我竞争。因为我只是在玩，一天玩16个小时。如果其他人想与我竞争，他们就会去工作，他们会输，因为他们不会一周七天每天工作16个小时。“[77]
What was your figure where you thought you were financially safe?
你认为自己在财务上是安全的，你的数字是多少？
Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it. But the lust for money is bad. The lust for money is not bad in a social sense. It’s not bad in the sense of “you’re a bad person for lusting for money.” It’s bad for you.
金钱不是万恶之源，它没有什么邪恶之处。但是，对金钱的欲望是不好的。从社会意义上讲，对金钱的贪婪并不是坏事。从“你是一个贪财的坏人”的意义上来说，这并不是坏事。这对你不好。

Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.
贪财对我们不好，因为这是一个无底洞。它会一直占据你的脑海。如果你爱钱，而且你能赚到钱，那么钱永远不够。永远不会满足，因为欲望被打开了，而且在某个数字上没有关闭。认为它会在某个数字关闭是一种谬论。

The punishment for the love of money is delivered at the same time as the money. As you make money, you just want even more, and you become paranoid and fearful of losing what you do have. There’s no free lunch.
对金钱的爱的惩罚是与金钱同时进行的。当你赚钱的时候，你只会想要更多，你会变得偏执，害怕失去你所拥有的东西。天下没有免费的午餐。

You make money to solve your money and material problems. I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. It’s very easy to keep upgrading your lifestyle as you make money. But if you can hold your lifestyle fixed and hopefully make your money in giant lump sums as opposed to a trickle at a time, you won’t have time to upgrade your lifestyle. You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free.
你赚钱是为了解决你的金钱和物质问题。我认为，远离这种对金钱的持续热爱的最好方法是，在赚钱的同时不要升级你的生活方式。在赚钱的同时不断升级你的生活方式是非常容易的。但是如果你能保持你的生活方式不变，并且希望你的钱是一次性的，而不是涓涓细流，那么你就没有时间升级你的生活方式了。你可能会走得很远，实际上在经济上变得自由了。

Another thing that helps: I value freedom above everything else. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don’t want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. For me, freedom is my number one value.
另一件有帮助的事情是：我把自由看得比一切都重要。各种各样的自由：做我想做的事的自由，不做我不想做的事情的自由，不受我自己的情绪或可能扰乱我平静的事情的自由。对我来说，自由是我的第一价值。

To the extent money buys freedom, it’s great. But to the extent it makes me less free, which it definitely does at some level as well, I don’t like it. [74]
就金钱能买到自由的程度而言，这是很棒的。但在一定程度上，它让我变得不那么自由，这在某种程度上肯定也是如此，我不喜欢它。

The winners of any game are the people who are so addicted they continue playing even as the marginal utility from winning declines.
任何游戏的赢家都是那些沉迷于游戏的人，即使赢球的边际效用下降了，他们也会继续玩下去。

Do I have to start a company to be successful?
我一定要开一家公司才能成功吗？
The most successful class of people in Silicon Valley on a consistent basis are either the venture capitalists (because they are diversified and control what used to be a scarce resource) or people who are very good at identifying companies that have just hit product/market fit. Those people have the background, expertise, and references those companies really want to help them scale. Then, they go into the latest Dropbox or the latest Airbnb.
硅谷一贯最成功的一类人要么是风险资本家(因为他们是多元化的，控制着过去稀缺的资源)，要么是非常善于识别刚刚达到产品/市场匹配的公司的人。这些人拥有这些公司真正想要帮助他们扩大规模的背景、专业知识和推荐人。然后，他们进入最新的Dropbox或最新的Airbnb。

The people who were at Google, then joined Facebook when it was one hundred people, and then joined Stripe when it was one hundred people?
那些在谷歌工作的人，然后在Facebook是100人的时候加入了Facebook，然后在它是100人的时候加入了条纹公司？
When Zuckerberg was just starting to scale his company and panicked, he was like, “I don’t know how to do this.” And he called Jim Breyer [venture capitalist and founder of Accel Partners]. And Jim Breyer said, “Well, I have this really great head of product at this other company, and you need this person.” Those people tend to do the best, risk -adjusted over a long period of time, other than the venture investors themselves. [30]
当扎克伯格刚刚开始扩大他的公司规模并惊慌失措时，他就像是，“我不知道该怎么做。”他还称吉姆·布雷耶(Jim Breyer)为[风险投资家、Accel Partners创始人]。吉姆·布雷耶说：“嗯，我在另一家公司有一个非常棒的产品主管，你需要这个人。”这些人往往做得最好，在很长一段时间内进行风险调整，而不是风险投资者自己。

Some of the most successful people I’ve seen in Silicon Valley had breakouts very early in their careers. They got promoted to VP, director, or CEO, or started a company that did well fairly early. If you’re not getting promoted through the ranks, it gets a lot harder to catch up later in life. It’s good to be in a smaller company early because there’s less of an infrastructure to prevent early promotion. [76]
我在硅谷见过的一些最成功的人在他们职业生涯的早期就取得了突破。他们被提升为副总裁、董事或首席执行官，或者很早就创办了一家业绩不错的公司。如果你在职级中得不到晋升，那么在以后的生活中要想迎头赶上就会困难得多。提早进入一家规模较小的公司是件好事，因为阻止提早晋升的基础设施较少。“[76]
For someone who is early in their career (and maybe even later), the single most important thing about a company is the alumni network you’re going to build. Think about who you will work with and what those people are going on to do. [76]
对于处于职业生涯早期(甚至更晚)的人来说，公司最重要的一件事就是你要建立的校友关系网。想一想你将与谁一起工作，以及这些人将会做些什么。“[76]
